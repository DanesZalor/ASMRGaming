![gamelogo](.images/gamelogo.png?raw=true "Logo of the ARG")
 
A sandbox coding game where players can assemble their own robots by modifying their parts, writing instructions, and transferring those instructions to the robot through a programming language called assembly language.
 
## Core Mechanics
Robot contains a CPU, RAM, Register, and Peripherals and the player can put the program in the robot in which the robot can interpret/understand it accordingly.
 
The robot has different parts/peripherals that can be modified/change based on the player’s choice, these are; sensors, steering, and combat
 
Sensors: this part allows the robot to “see” its environment. The player could choose between a Camera, a part where the robot could see in a wide area. and a Laser, a part where the robot could pinpoint a robot in a straight far line.
 
Steering: this part allows the robot to “move” through its environment. The player could choose between tank tracks, where the tank could move forward and back but could only turn if either the left or right has a higher movement than its opposite side. And a car tires, where the car’s back wheel is the forward and back while the front wheel is responsible of the direction.
 
Combat: this part allows the robot to “attack” enemy robots. The player could choose between a Chopper, an area attack but has low damage. And a Drill, a direct front in a straight line attack that deals high damage.
